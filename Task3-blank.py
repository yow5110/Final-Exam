# Create a separate copy of the Task 2 code and remove all animation sections. 
# Write a simple for loop that advances time for 1000 timesteps, 
# in replacement for the animation section. 
# The for loop will mostly have the same contents as the animate() function, 
# including the ode.move_RK2() part and the reflective boundary conditions part. 

# Evolve the system for 1000 timesteps. 
# At the last timestep, calculate the average kinetic energy of 
# all the particles (a single number) 
# and the 95% confidence interval of kinetic energies 
# (two numbers bracketing the average).
